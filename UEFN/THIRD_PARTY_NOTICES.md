# Third-Party Notices — UEFN backend

The UEFN backend adapts patterns (main-thread command queue, slate-post-tick drain,
`unreal.*` serializer, handler registry) from the project below. The code here is a
re-implementation rather than a verbatim copy; the security model, lifecycle, autostart,
protocol, and capability model were rewritten. See `docs/uefn/PORTING_LEDGER.md` for the
component-by-component ledger.
